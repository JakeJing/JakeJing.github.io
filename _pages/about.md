I am a PhD student at the Department of Comparative Linguage Science, University of Zürich, with a background of **evolutionary linguistics** and **linguistic typology**. My research focuses on exploring the structural rules and evolutionary trends of word orders in the world’s languages. I am trying to perceive these typological regualarities and variation from two perspectives:

1. comparing the observed results from large annotated corpora against various random baselines;
1. modelling the evolution of typological traits in the histories of language families via phylogenetic inference.

A data-driven approach
======
We are living in a world that is constructed and defined by languages. We are communicating with the world via languages, and the languages we acquire may in turn affect the way we think and behave. To have a better understanding of our languages and ourselves, we need to have a data-driven approach, especially in this digital world. I am open to all sorts of data (*movie subtitles*, *wikipedia databases*, *parallel corpora*, *dependency treebanks*) in different languages, though they can sometimes be quite nosiy. We can preprocess these raw texts (tokenizing, tagging and parsing) with a pre-trained language models, and get a more elaborated data format with additional linguistic annotations. This corpus-based approach is important for us to get an idea of how our languages are organized.


An evolutionary approach

Languages are evolving!
