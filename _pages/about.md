I have finished my PhD at the Department of Comparative Linguage Science, University of Zürich, with a focus of **evolutionary linguistics** and **linguistic typology**. My research focuses on exploring the structural rules and evolutionary trends of word orders in the world’s languages. I am trying to investigate these typological regularities and variation from two perspectives:

1. comparing the observed results from large annotated corpora against various random baselines;
1. modelling the evolution of typological traits in the histories of language families via phylogenetic inference.

A data-driven approach
======
We are living in a world that is constructed and defined by languages. We are communicating with the world via languages, and the languages we acquire may in turn affect the way we think and behave. To better understand our languages and ourselves, we need to have a data-driven approach, especially in this digital age. I am open to all sorts of data (*movie subtitles*, *wikipedia databases*, *parallel corpora*, *dependency treebanks*) in different languages, though they can sometimes be quite nosiy. We can preprocess these raw texts (tokenizing, tagging and parsing) with a pre-trained language models, and get a more elaborated data format with additional linguistic annotations. This corpus-based approach is important for us to get an idea of how our languages are organized.


An evolutionary approach
======
Languages are evolving! The languages we are using can tell us where we are from and where we are going. Like genes, languages also encode important information of our ancestral history. With the application of comparative methods, like *phylogenetic inference*, it allows us to estimate the language history and detect the evolutionary trends of cetain linguistic features in time and space. Like genetic selection, those linguistic traits that are easy to process, produce or learn, will have a higher chance to be perserved and transmitted from generation to generation. Thus, it is necessary to model the dynamic processes of languages and figure out the selective forces that constrain the language change across the world's languages.
