I am a PhD student at the Department of Comparative Linguage Science, University of Zürich, with a background of evolutionary linguistics and linguistic typology. My research focuses on exploring the structural rules and evolutionary trends of word orders in the world’s languages. I am trying to perceive these typological regualarities and variation from two perspectives:

1. comparing the observed results from large annotated corpora against various random baselines;
1. modelling the evolution of typological traits in the histories of language families via phylogenetic inference.

A data-driven approach
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.


Understanding language dynamics
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
