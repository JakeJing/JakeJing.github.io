In this blog, I will introduce a new R package `chkptstanr`, which
allows checkpoints in `stan`. This feature is useful when you want to
cache the model outputs by certain time steps or resume a long run at
specific points due to an interruption. In general, this package can be
considered as a wrapper for `cmdstan`, and thus you need to download and
install `cmdstan` on your machine. Here are the step-by-step instruction
on how you can deploy the environment and run the stan model via
chkptstanr.

## 1. Install cmdstan


The `cmdstan` is the shell interface to stan and can be integrated well
with the command-line interface. It also supports GPU computation via
OpenCL and multi-threading (see the latest version of [cmdstan user’s
guide](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases)). You can install the cmdstan by the following commands.

``` bash
# download cmdstan-2.29.2
wget https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/download/v2.29.2/cmdstan-2.29.2.tar.gz
tar -xf cmdstan-2.29.2.tar.gz

cd cmdstan-2.29.2
make build
```

If you are interested in setting up cmdstan with GPU support, I am
including my configuration for the Snowy cluster.

``` bash
# load the necessary packages
module use /sw/EasyBuild/snowy/modules/all/
module load intelcuda/2019b
module load gcc/9.3.0
module load R/4.1.1
module load R_packages/4.1.1

# set the local configuration
cd cmdstan-2.29.2
echo "STAN_OPENCL=TRUE" > make/local
make build
```

Let’s check the configuration by running an example stan model
(bernoulli) inside the cmdstan folder.

``` bash
cd cmdstan-2.29.2
ls example/bernoulli
# bernoulli.data.R bernoulli.data.json  bernoulli.stan

# Note: compile the model without the suffix of .stan
make example/bernoulli/bernoulli
examples/bernoulli/bernoulli sample data \
file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.json output file=output.csv
```

## 2. Run stan model via chkptstanr


Now we have `cmdstan` installed on your computer and we can try to run a
stan model via `chkptstanr`. Before that we need to load the necessary
packages and specify the `cmdstan` path. Here I am using a version from
github.

``` r
library(cmdstanr)
# library(devtools)
# install_github("donaldRwilliams/chkptstanr")
library(chkptstanr)
library(bayesplot)
set_cmdstan_path("../cmdstan-2.29.2")
```

### (1) Model

For simplicity, I am using a stan model from the `chkptstanr` package by
adjusting the model with the new array syntax, and you can of course try
your own stan model.

``` r
stan_code <- "
data {
  int<lower=0> n;
  array[n] real y; 
  array[n] real<lower=0> sigma; 
}
parameters {
  real mu;
  real<lower=0> tau; 
  vector[n] eta; 
}
transformed parameters {
  vector[n] theta; 
  theta = mu + tau * eta; 
}
model {
  target += normal_lpdf(eta | 0, 1); 
  target += normal_lpdf(y | theta, sigma);  
}
"
```

### (2) Data

``` r
stan_data <- list(n = 8,
                  y = c(28,  8, -3,  7, -1,  1, 18, 12),
                  sigma = c(15, 10, 16, 11,  9, 11, 10, 18))
```

### (3) Run the analysis

It is worth noting that when you first run the model, you often need to
create a folder via `create_folder`. But if you want to resume a
previous run, you just need to specify the path to previously created
folder. To achieve this, we include a conditional statement to check the
existence of the folder.

``` r
# important: check for the existence of folder
name_folder = "stan_chkpt_m1"
if(dir.exists(name_folder)){
  path = paste0("./", name_folder)
}else{
  path = create_folder(folder_name = name_folder)
}
# important: specify the stan_code_path
stan_code_path = paste0(path, "/stan_model/model.stan") 
```

``` r
fit_m1 <- chkpt_stan(model_code = stan_code, data = stan_data, 
                     iter_warmup = 1000, iter_sampling = 2000,
                     iter_per_chkpt = 250, path = path)
```

You can directly stop the running model or specify a longer sampling
iteration. Normally, `chkpt_stan` will resume the model from the cached
checkpoints, no matter whether they occur at the warm-up or sampling
stage. Another advantage is that if the checkpointing is completed, the
model won’t be executed even though you run the same command once again.
If you really want to rerun the model, you can delete the cached folder
by using the `unlink` or `system` function.

``` r
# remove the cached folder
unlink(path, recursive = T)
# system(command = paste0("rm -r ", path))
```

It is worth noting that the current version of `chkptstanr` does not
allow you to resize the warm-up iterations or change the iteration per
checkpoint between two runs, since they may cause some difficulties to
combine different checkpoint draws.

### (4) Visualization

``` r
draws <- combine_chkpt_draws(fit_m1)
bayesplot::mcmc_trace(draws, regex_pars = c("mu", "tau", "eta")) +
geom_vline(xintercept = seq(0, 2000, 250), alpha = 0.25, size = 2)
```
