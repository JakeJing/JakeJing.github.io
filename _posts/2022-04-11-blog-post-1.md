The development of `dplyr` and `purrr` packages makes the workflow of R programming more smooth and flexible. The dplyr package provides an elegant way of manipulating data.frames or tibbles in a column-wise (e.g., **select**, **filter**, **mutate**, **arrange**, **group_by**, **summarise** and **case_when**) or row-wise (**rowwise**, **c_across**, and **ungroup**) manner. It also fits well with the `map` function by applying an anonymous function to each column, or applying a user-defined function to each row.

The purrr package allows us to map a function to each element of a list. You can also **select**, **filter**, **modify**, **combine** and **summarise** a list (see [this blog](https://towardsdev.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-purrr-4cfe78e92392) for an overview). Note that the default output from `map` function is a list of the same length as the input data, though you can easily reformat the output into a data.frame via `map_dfr` and `map_dfc` functions.

Here we focus on comparing and understanding the `nest` and `split `functions in data simulation and inference. Specifically, two data structures (**nested data** vs. **splitted data**) are used for simulating and fitting linear regression models across different types.

## 1. Linear regression via nested structures

#### (1) Function

We first define a function to generate the response (*y*) by providing the predictor (*x*), *intercept* and *slope*.

```R
# function to generate the response
generate_response <- function(x, intercept, slope) {
  x * slope + intercept + rnorm(length(x), 0, 30)
}
```

#### (2) Simulation with given parameters

To simulate data for each type (A, B or C), we put the parameters in a tibble, since it allows nested objects with a list of vectors as a column. To generate the response, we use a **rowwise** function by applying the **generate_response** function to each row.

```R
# it is recommended to use tibble format
parameters <- tibble(
  type = c("A", "B", "C"),
  x = list(1:100, 1:100, 1:100),
  intercept = c(1, 3, 5),
  slope = c(2, 4, 3)
)
# note: convert the vector responses into a list
simulated_df <- parameters %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(y = list(generate_response(x, intercept, slope))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unnest(c(x, y))
```

#### (3) Run the linear model

With the simulated data.frame or tibble, we can create a nested data and map the linear model for each type. After that, we can extract the predicted values and 95% credible intervals.

```R
# nesting data by each type and run lm via map
lm_results <- simulated_df %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    models = map(data, ~ lm(y ~ x, data = .x)),
    summaries = map(models, ~ broom::glance(.x)),
    model_coef = map(models, ~ broom::tidy(.x)),
    pred = map(models, ~ predict(.x, interval = "confidence"))
  )
# extract the predicted results
pred_ci <- lm_results %>%
  dplyr::select(type, pred) %>%
  unnest(pred) %>%
  pull(pred) %>%
  set_colnames(c("fit", "lwr", "upr"))
```

#### (4) Visualization

To visualize the raw data and the fitted lines, we need to combine them by row, and draw the fitted line and credible intervals via *geom_line* and *geom_ribbon* functions from ggplot2.

```R
cbind(simulated_df, pred_ci) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = x, y = y, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, fill = type, color = NULL),
    alpha = .6
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit), size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~type) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## 2. Linear regression via splitted structures

Alternatively, we can split the simulated data by each type and replicate the whole analysis by using `map` functions. Note that you may still need to convert the data into a data.frame so as to combine them by row.

```R
parameters <- list(
  type = c("A", "B", "C"),
  x = list(1:100, 1:100, 1:100),
  intercept = c(1, 3, 5),
  slope = c(2, 4, 3)
)
```

```R
simulated_df <- parameters %>%
  pmap_dfr(., function(type, x, intercept, slope) {
    data.frame(
      type = type, x = x,
      y = generate_response(x, intercept, slope)
    )
  })
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeJing/jakejing.github.io/master/_posts/pics/splitted_pmap.png)

```R
pred_ci <- simulated_df %>%
  split(.$type) %>%
  map(~ lm(y ~ x, data = .x)) %>%
  map_dfr(~ as.data.frame(predict(.x, interval = "confidence")))
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeJing/jakejing.github.io/master/_posts/pics/split_lm.png)

```R
cbind(simulated_df, pred_ci) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = x, y = y, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, fill = type, color = NULL),
    alpha = .6
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit), size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~type) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## 3. Concluding remarks

- As far as I can see, the combination of `split` and `map` functions seems to be a bit more intuitive and easier to follow. You do not need to constantly `nest` and `unnest` the data. More importantly, nested objected is somehow compressed in the tibble objects and make it less tractable.
- Nested data structure is useful when you want to apply several functions to each model objects and the results can be directly saved in a tidy data.frame. For the splitted data structure, you need to apply the function to each model object separately.
- Nested structure often relies on list for data simulation and packing model outputs, whereas splitted structure need to convert and combine the outputs into data.frames for visualization.
