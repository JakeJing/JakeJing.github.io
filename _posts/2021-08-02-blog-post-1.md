With the development of **dplyr** or its umbrella package **tidyverse**, it becomes quite straightforward to perform operations over columns or rows in R. These column- or row-wise methods can also be directly integrated with other dplyr verbs like `select`, `mutate`, `filter` and `summarise`, making them more comparable with other functions in `apply` or `map` families. In this blog, I will briefly cover some useful manipulations over rows or columns.

## 1. Column-wise operation

**Example 1:** select those string columns with less than 5 levels in the dataset of **starwars**.

```R
# anonymous function
starwars %>% 
  select_if(~ is.character(.x) & length(unique(.x)) <= 5)
```
We can use a convenient function `select_if` to identify certain columns by multiple criteria. This is essentially equivalent to the following expanded format.

```R
# expanded form
starwars %>%
  select_if(function(x) is.character(x) & length(unique(x)) <= 5)
```

It is worth noting that we are using tilde ($\sim$) to define an anonymous function, and thus we should use $.x$ to refer to the selected columns. See this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynaHKNdAAwk&t=364s) for detailed illustration of tilde ($\sim$), dot ($.$) and dot x ($.x$) in dplyr. If there is only one single argument in the anonymous function (in most cases), you can use dot (.) or placeholder (...1) as alternatives. In other words, the dot (.), placeholder (â€¦1) and dot x (.x) are equivalents in a single argument anonymous function. For details, see the underlying function specifications via`as_mapper`.

```R
as_mapper(~ length(unique(.x)))
# <lambda>
# function (..., .x = ..1, .y = ..2, . = ..1) 
# length(unique(.x))
# attr(,"class")
# [1] "rlang_lambda_function" "function" 
```

If you want to calculate the levels of those selected columns, you can try `across` function and `summarise` the number of levels by column. 

```R
# solution 1
starwars %>% 
  summarise(across(where(is.character), ~ length(unique(.x))))

# solution 2 (recommended)
starwars %>% 
  summarise_if(is.character, ~ length(unique(.x)))
```

Alternatively, you can make use of the `map` or `map_dbl` function in **purrr** by the following command. Note that when a `map` function is applied to a data.frame, it will operate over columns by default. 

```R
# solution 3
starwars %>%
  select_if(~ is.character(.x)) %>%
  map_dbl(~length(unique(.x)))
```

**Example 2:** select those numeric columns and calculate the means and sds across columns in the dataset of **starwars**.

```R
# solution 1
starwars %>% 
  summarise(across(where(~ is.numeric(.x)), 
                   list(Mean = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = T), 
                        Sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = T))))
```

This example provides us a good illustration of the use of dot x (.x) in **dplyr** style syntax, since we have some missing values (NAs) in certain columns. Thus, we need to specify the parameter with `na.rm = T` inside the functions. 

There is indeed a more convenient and elegant way of solving this by using the function of `summarise_if`. It allows us to select certain columns and operate by columns like this:

```R
# solution 2 (recommended)
starwars %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric,
               list(Sum = sum, Mean = mean, Sd = sd),
               na.rm = T)
```

If you are more comfortable with the `map` function in **purrr**, you can resolve this issue in a different way. **Note**: we are mapping three functions to a data.frame, and combining them as named vectors. This will return a list of named vectors.

```R
# solution 3
starwars %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  map(., ~ c(Sum = sum(.x, na.rm = T), 
             Mean = mean(.x, na.rm = T),
             Sd = sd(.x, na.rm = T)))
```

## 2. Row-wise operation

**Example 3:** calculate the **sums**, **means** and **sds** for each row for the dataset of **iris**.

```R
iris %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    Rowsum = sum(c_across(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width)),
    Rowsd = sd(c_across(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width)), 
    Rowmean = mean(c_across(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width))
 ) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Here the function `c_across` is specifically designed to work with `rowwise` operations. **Note:** `rowwise` groups your data by row (class: *rowwise_df*), and it is best to `ungroup` immediately. Of course, if you are  more comfortable with `apply` function, you can also use the following command.

```R
iris %>% 
  select(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width) %>% 
  apply(., 1, function(x) c(sum(x), sd(x), mean(x))) %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% t()
```
